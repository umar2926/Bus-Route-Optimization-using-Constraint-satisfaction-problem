**Bus Route Optimization using CSP Algorithm**
**Introduction**
This project aims to develop an online bus schedule management system using Flask, a Python web framework. The system processes bus routes and schedules from CSV files, providing an interface for users to search and manage bus schedules efficiently.

**Features**
Web Application: Developed using Flask to manage and display bus schedules.
Automated Schedule Processing: Reads data from CSV files to generate bus stop schedules.
Interactive UI: Users can search for buses between specific stops and view schedules.
Autocomplete Feature: Helps users efficiently search for their desired stops.
Contributor Page: Details about the project's contributors.
**Methodology**
Data Reading: Reads data from routes.csv, stops.csv, and bus_times.csv.
Distance Calculation: Calculates distances between stops for each route.
Bus Distribution: Distributes buses across routes based on stops.
Schedule Initialization: Sets up initial bus schedules.
Schedule Updates: Records bus arrival times and updates schedules.
**Future Work**
Integrate real-time tracking and updates for bus schedules.
Develop a mobile application.
Implement a feedback system.
Add features like route planning, fare calculation, and bus capacity information
